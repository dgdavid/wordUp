## what was it?

This was a simple three-day project to play with
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) (version 1.3 at that time) since I wanted
to learn a little more (besides of reading) about this front-end web
application framework before starting to use it in a small
private project at work.

The idea was to build a simple _meta-dictionary_ to search the given word
simultaneously in several well-known services through their APIs and have, in
the same place and with a simple interface, its translation, pronunciation,
related grammatical topics, etc, easing the process of learning a language.

However, most online dictionaries/services had/have commercial APIs and require
to send a request to test it. Furthermore, in the most of the cases, they
delayed a long time to send me the access token.

So, at the end, I discarded the idea and stopped working on it.


## why keep it on Github?

_Why not?_ :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Who knows, maybe some day I could resume it with the last trending language and/or
framework :wink: (at the moment of writing these lines, it could be
[Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or even [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)
:open_mouth:)
